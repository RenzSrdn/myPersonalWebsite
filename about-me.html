    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Renz Serdenia and I was born and raised in Milan Italy. <br>
        If you ask my parents what kind of a person I am, the first thing they'll tell you is that I'm a pretty stubborn person. <br>
        If I fix my mind onto something I won't get it off of it until I do it or have it! <br>
        And If you ask the same question to my friends, they'll tell you that I'm a responsible person and I agree with that. <br>
        I'm a well organized person, always on time and I plan everything for everything! <br>
        And of course I have bad things too about me. <br>
        Like for example, sometimes I'm a perfectionist and I tend to do and redo something until it's perfect. <br>
        I also want to admit that sometimes I tend to speak before thinking but I'm working on that.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>My main hobbies are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Reading <br>
            <p>
                I just started reading this 2023. And I wish I had started sooner! <br>
                Self-help books are my main category but I've also read a couple of fiction books. <br>
                I like philosophy and psycology books as well. I think they can help me undersand <br>
                more about my emotions and how to deal with them.

            Sports <br>
            <p>
                I've always been a sporty guy. I grew up doing sports. <br>
                I started in elementary school with some basketball but I wasn't good at it <br>
                so I had to switch sport. Tried football and played it until the end of middle school. <br>
                Stopped playing it because of an injury.     <br>
                In the second year of high school I started MMA and I've done that for 2 years <br>
                then I switched to boxing. <br>
                Been doing till today!(April 26 2023)

        <li>
            Watching movies <br>
            <p>
                I usually go to the cinema 5/6 times a year and I watch a lot movies on Netflix. <br>
                I like to analyze movies and tv shows in every way. Just to add emphasis to this hobby of mine, <br>
                I can tell that I went to a photography and cinematography school in my fist year in highschool but since it was <br>
                very far from where I live, I had to swtich school.
                My go to categories are Sci-fi and autobiography!

    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I have many interests but the ones worth mentioning are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Tech<br>
            <p>
                I usually watch youtube videos and documentaries about new phones, laptops, computers... not only that! <br>
                Even new innovative technologies like AI, electric cars, hydrogen cars, reengineered products like <br>
                the toilet made for developing countries by Samsung and Bill Gates. <br>
                I find fascinating how tech can be used in many ways to make our lives easier and I always dream about <br>
                a future where no one is limited in doing something. Where anyone can go wherever they want without any physical
                limitations.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Science <br> 
            <p>
                I love space. I love reading articles about a new discovery, a breakthrough in any scientific area. <br>
                I love visiting science museums, share opinions with people, watch videos about how things work. <br>
                I love sience in general. In summer 2022 I went to Valencia, Spain's city of science. <br>
                It was a really exciting experience. I will definitely visit the other cities of science around the world.
            </p>

        <li>
            Sustainability <br>
            <p>
                Another major interest worth mentioning is my deep care about the environment. <br>
                I try to be as sustainable as possible. To do so I signed up to a course about sustainability held at my University. <br>
                Being a responsible and sustainable person is crucial for the future of our planet. <br>
                In my opinion tech can help us solve a lot of problems related to climate change and sustainability. <br>
                I wanna recommend you a youtuber that I've been following recently. <br>
